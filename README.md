# Image-Classifier

This was the capstone of the Pytorch Deep Learning Scholarship Challenge. The objective was to identify flowers by their names. We were supplied training and testing data as well as the labels for the flowers. We just had to build a classifier that would run against Udacity's own set of testing data. You can see the code and results within this notebook.

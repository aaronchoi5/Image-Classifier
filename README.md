# Image-Classifier

This was the capstone of the Pytorch Deep Learning Scholarship Challenge. The objective was to identify flowers by their names. We were supplied training and testing data as well as the labels for the flowers. We just had to build a classifier that would run against Udacity's own set of testing data. You can see the code and results within this notebook. I used my own google drive account to act as the repository for the data. I also used Google Collab as I did not have a powerful GPU to speed up the training. There are a few lines of code at the beginning that show how to set up google collab and google drive. Later you'll see the model training and getting better at classifying flowers!
